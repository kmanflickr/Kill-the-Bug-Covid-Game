# Kill-the-Bug-Covid-Game
Slow moving target game. One would really need patience. 
Double click KilltheBug Application icon to play the game
click on the virus approaching from right of the screen to release the red bubble vaccine
Since the speed at which the target virus moves is very slow it would take quite some time to build up. 
Best is to get rid of them before they build up by a lot. 
Once they build up by a lot you would notice they could only be killed at a slower rate,
Games over if any of the virus makes it to the left hand corner of the screen
